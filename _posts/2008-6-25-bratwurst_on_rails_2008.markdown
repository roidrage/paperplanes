So [RailsConf Europe 2008](http://en.oreilly.com/railseurope2008/public/content/home) is upon us, not for another two months, but you gotta be prepared right? You did sign up, right? Good.

What's even better: The night before RailsConf Europe, [Bratwurst On Rails](http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com) will once more treat you to free snacks and socializing with fellow Rails nerds. Sound good? Excellent. Then jump on over to the <a href="http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com">website</a> and sign up already!
