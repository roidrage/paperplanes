[Says Steven Frank](http://stevenf.com/2007/09/bugs_are_magic_tricks.php) (of [Panic Software](http://www.panic.com/), of [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit/) fame):

> A good bug, I mean a really good, pound-your-head-on-the-desk-for-a-week bug, is exactly like a magic trick in that something impossible appears to be happening.

Spot on, Steven. If you had one of these yourself, you know how true it is.
