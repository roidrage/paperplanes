I recently remembered that there used to be a nice plugin for [SIMBL](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) that'll put e.g. TextMate into full screen mode. Something TextMate itself doesn't support out of the box, but that comes in handy to reduce distractions while working with it.

I looked for the plugin, and [found it](http://ianhenderson.org/megazoomer.html), but the last update was in 2006, so it very likely wouldn't run nicely on Intel Macs. Other people on [MacUpdate](http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/21275/megazoomer) were asking for a Universal version of the plugin, so I gave it a try.

Luckily it compiled without any problem, so I give you [megazoomer as a Universal Binary](http://www.paperplanes.de/files/megazoomer.zip). The code is practically unchanged, though I did put it up on [GitHub](http://github.com/mattmatt/megazoomer/tree/master) (you'll also find the simple installation instructions there) to preserve it for the near and distant future (whatever it beholds). All credit (and copyright) belongs to [Ian Henderson](http://ianhenderson.org/) who wrote it in the first place.

Enjoy!
