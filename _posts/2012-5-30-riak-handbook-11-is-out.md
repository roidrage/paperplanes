I'm happy to report that the [Riak Handbook](http://riakhandbook.com/?pp) has
hit a major update, bringing a whopping 43 pages of new content with it. If you
already bought the book, this is a free update, and instructions how and where
to download it were sent in a separate email.

Here's a run down of what's new:

* The book was updated for Riak 1.1.

* The biggest new feature of the Riak Handbook is a section entirely dedicated to
  use cases, full of examples and code from real time usage scenarios, giving you
  food for thought when it comes to using Riak in your applications. Rumor has it
  there's also an introduction on Riak CS in there, the new cloud storage system
  that's API-compatible with Amazon's S3.

* Full coverage on pre- and post-commit hooks. Get ready for a thorough
  run-through of things you can do with your data before and after it's written to
  Riak. Covers both JavaScript and Erlang examples.

* To go full circle on deploying Erlang code in a Riak cluster, the book now has a
  section dedicated to it, so you don't have to manually compile Erlang code every
  time you update it.

* More details on secondary indexes, how you can use them to store multiple values
  for a single document and how you can use them to model object associations.

* A section on load balancing Riak nodes.

* An introduction on where on a network you can and should put your Riak nodes.

* A big, big section on monitoring and an overview of Riak Control, the new
  cluster management tool introduced in Riak 1.1.

* Last but not least, the book now comes as a man page. Need to look something
  up real quick while you're working on the command line? No worries, drop the
  man page in your $MANPATH and type "man riak". Easy to search when you're
  working remotely on a Riak node, or if you're generally a fan of spending a
  lot of time on the command line (just like I am).

To celebrate the new release, the [Riak Handbook](http://riakhandbook.com/?pp)
is 25% off until next Monday, June 4th. It's a release party, and everyone's
invited!
