[Jenifer Altman](http://www.jeniferaltman.com/) did it. She finished the book for our Polaroid project. 25 Polaroid photographers from all over the world say farewell to a piece of photographic history. Here's a sneaky peek at the cover:

The book is available for pre-order, and will ship in the first weeks of July. It's strictly limited to 500 copies, so [get it](http://www.fortheloveoflight.com/) while you can.

Did I mention I'm in it? I can't wait to hold it in my hands, and browse through all the photos.

If you're living in Berlin, there's currently an exhibition on Polaroids called ["The Last Ten"](http://berlin.unlike.net/events/100036-The-Last-Ten-Shots) at the [Bongout showroom](http://www.bongout.org/).
