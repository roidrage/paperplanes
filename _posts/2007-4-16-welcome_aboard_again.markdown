So this is it. My new blog. It doesn't look like much, but I'm working on it. Here's where I'll write about my adventures as a freelancer, things related to Rails and things that bother me, things I like and my view on life as a freelancer and Mac OS X nerd.

So what is Paperplanes? Paperplanes is the name of my business as a freelancer.

Who are you? I'm an almost 30-year-old freelance software developer, living in Berlin/Germany. I've been freelancing for almost a year now, and so far I can't complain.

What do I do? I used to do a lot of Java-based work. You can read the results of that over at my Java-related blog <a href="http://www.javaddicts.net">Javaddicts</a>.

So why a new blog? As a freelancer, I've been doing much more than program Java. Lately I find myself writing more and more apps with Rails which I really enjoy.

What's gonna happen next? The design for the page has been in my drawer for almost a year now, and it's time to finish it. So that's what I'll do.
