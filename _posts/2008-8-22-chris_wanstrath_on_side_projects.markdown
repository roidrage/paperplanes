Chris (of [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [err.the_blog](http://errtheblog.com/) fame) gave an inspiring keynote at this year's Ruby Hoedown. Check out the [essay](http://gist.github.com/6443), or enjoy him in [full visual glory](http://rubyhoedown2008.confreaks.com/08-chris-wanstrath-keynote.html).

Inspiring quote to scratch your itch:

> "In fact, stop worrying so much about other people.  Every time I've
worked on a project I thought other people would really love, it was a
massive flop.  Every time I've worked on a project I loved, it worked.
 If you're sitting in this room, your taste is not as far off from
those around you as you'd think.  Build something you love and others
will love it, too.  (Not everyone, of course.)"

Seriously, go check it out.
