title: Daily AWS Wtf and German Rails Conference
tags: rails aws
---
I've started a new blog (don't worry, I have not abandoned this one), specifically targeting experiences, wtf's and workarounds for the latter on Amazon's Web Services. I've been working quite a lot with them recently, and there's heaps of dark corners around, and things you need to be aware of. That's what that blog is about. Head on over to [Daily AWS Wtf](http://dailyawswtf.com) and give it a read. It's powered by the people of [Peritor](http://www.peritor.com), so there'll be other people writing too.

The annual one and only [German Rails Conference](http://www.rails-konferenz.de) (some might call it Rails Konferenz) is upon us. I'll be speaking about legacy code, and I'll also be giving a tutorial on refactoring Rails applications, together with [Jonathan Weiss](http://blog.innerewut.de). It's a great one day conference with a German audience. Great occasion to meet the German Rails scene. Hope to see you there!
