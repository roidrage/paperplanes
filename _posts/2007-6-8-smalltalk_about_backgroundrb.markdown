I held a small presentation about BackgrounDRb yesterday at the meeting of the Ruby User Group Berlin. It wasn't a very big presentation, since actually, there's not a lot to say about BackgrounDRb. But if you want to check it out, you can get the <a href="/files/BackgrounDRb.pdf">slides</a> and the little sample <a href="/files/backgroundrb_demo.zip">application</a>.

It's nice to see the user group grow. Yesterday there were about 35 guests, the month before almost 50. If you live in Berlin or in the area, it's definitely worth getting to know the people there. And there's a good chance that you can get new gigs there as well.
