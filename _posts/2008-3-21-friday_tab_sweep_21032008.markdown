Lots of open tabs to be swept. Brace yourselves.

**Git**

* [Git - SVN Crash Course](http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html). Coming from Subversion? Lookie here.

* [Using git with Django Screencast](http://oebfare.com/blog/2008/jan/23/using-git-django-screencast/)

* [Learning git-svn in 5 minutes](http://tsunanet.blogspot.com/2007/07/learning-git-svn-in-5min.html)

* [gitnub](http://github.com/Caged/gitnub/wikis/home). I was really apalled by gitk (but then again, I'm appalled by most tools written in Tk), so this more Mac-style repository browser comes in quite handy.

* [Git SVN Workflow](http://andy.delcambre.com/2008/3/4/git-svn-workflow)

* [Railscast - Git on Rails](http://railscasts.com/episodes/96)

* [Git Peepcode](https://peepcode.com/products/git). Of course.

Can you tell I'm looking into Git right now?

**Ruby**

* [Matz' Google Tech Talk on Ruby 1.9](http://youtube.com/watch?v=oEkJvvGEtB4). Damn, Google employees have it all.

* [MacRuby - Ruby running on Objective-C](http://macdevnet.com/index.php/articles/ruby/918-ruby/216-macrubyarticle). A Ruby project by Apple. Awesome.

* [Ruby, an AppleScript Alternative](http://macdevelopertips.com/ruby/ruby-an-applescript-alternative-part-1.html). Part [#2](http://macdevelopertips.com/ruby/ruby-an-applescript-alternative-part-2.html) and [#3](http://macdevelopertips.com/ruby/ruby-an-applescript-alternative-part-3.html).

* [Castanaut: Ruby-powered OS X Screencasting DSL](http://www.rubyinside.com/castanaut-ruby-powered-os-x-screencasting-dsl-774.html)

* [Ruby 1.9 with Symbol#to___proc and (soon) curried Procs](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/to_proc-currying-ruby19). You know it from Rails, now this is Ruby standard: `:attributes.to_proc`.

* [Rush - OOP shell in Ruby](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/rush-oop-shell)

**Rails**

* [Tarantula vs. your Rails app](http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/2008/2/26/tarantula-vs-your-rails-app). Think of it as heckle for your application.

* [count vs. length vs. size](http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2008/2/27/count-length-size). A small tidbit on how each of these methods work on ActiveRecord association proxies.

* [Rails is the best thing that ever happened to Python](http://antoniocangiano.com/2008/03/04/rails-is-the-best-thing-that-ever-happened-to-python/)
