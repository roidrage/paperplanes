I've been using [xScope](http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope) for a while now, and I highly recommend it for everyone pushing around pixels, divs and whatnot. Its rulers and the loupe have become invaluable for me.

The recent upgrade to 2.0 (current is 2.1) introduced a neat new feature which quickly measures the dimensions of anything under the cursor. It'll find the next border in every direction and give you nice and easy measurements.

<div class="thumbnail" style="text-align:center; width:500px"><a href="http://skitch.com/mattie/gbg1/picture-1"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080211-kp8xqpfijk7783aypjmqeuqqwa.preview.jpg" alt="Picture 1" /></a></div>

Of course that's far from being all it does. Go check it out. It's a neat little gem. Available from the [IconFactory](http://iconfactory.com/home).

In other news, I finally decided to go on the <a href="http://twitter.com/roidrage">Twitters</a>.
