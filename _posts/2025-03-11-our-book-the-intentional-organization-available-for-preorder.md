üéâüö® The short and sweet: the book Sara and I have been working on since 2020 is officially available for preorder and launching on April 8, 2025! You [can learn more about it, request a sample chapter, and preorder the book on our site](https://intentionalorganization.com/book/?ref=paperplanes.de)!

We now live in a time when billionaires are stating that companies need more ‚Äúmasculine energy.‚Äù Diversity, inclusion, and equity are removed from an entire country‚Äôs vocabulary. Books are removed from libraries because they don‚Äôt match someone‚Äôs narrow view of the world. Science funding is pulled back from projects when they just mention certain words in their proposals and abstracts.

Publishing this book couldn‚Äôt seem more timely.

It seems more important that a book on management and leadership highlights the importance of fostering participation, of diverse perspectives, and a collective energy that comes from collaboration, open communication, and leadership principles built on clarity and continuous improvement.

All of these were the things that brought [Sara](https://saralouhicks.com) and I together in the first place. They are the guiding principles of ‚ÄúThe Intentional Organization,‚Äù both the company and the book that‚Äôs now available for preorder.

While the book seems timely, it has also been a labor of love for us. We set out to write for our past selves. It represents the level of support we felt was missing when we started out as founders. We wanted to know what someone‚Äôs tried, why they‚Äôve tried it, and how it worked out. We didn‚Äôt want a blueprint that we could copy to the letter, because that almost never works. We just wanted to take inspiration from the experience other folks had already accumulated. But try as we might, there weren‚Äôt a lot of books out there that fit the bill.

There is a cathartic element to writing this book for us, too. Writing about our own struggles while also reflecting on the common challenges our clients are facing has been painful at times, but also quite freeing. These aren‚Äôt experiences to be ashamed about. They happen to everyone at companies at all stages and sizes. We know because the folks who are struggling keep coming to us for advice. Whether in our coaching, at conferences, after talks, we hear stories, the struggles, the feeling of having nowhere to turn to, of having no one who‚Äôs shared the same struggles.

That‚Äôs what this book is about. We want to shine a light on the struggles of moving into management, no matter at what level. And we want to provide starting points to solve those common challenges, always having a humane work environment at heart, with a focus on participation and meeting each other at eye level, something that seems more important than ever right now.

We‚Äôre thrilled that the book is now available for preorder! We hope it‚Äôs useful to you and your team as you journey deeper into management and leadership.

Our cover embodies this spirit more than anything. Go read our [blog post](https://intentionalorganization.com/journal/we-wrote-a-book-you-can-preorder-now/?ref=paperplanes.de) on what‚Äôs behind it.
