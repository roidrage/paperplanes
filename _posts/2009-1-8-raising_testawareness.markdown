It's [test-awareness month](http://www.railstips.org/2009/1/6/test-or-die) over at [RailsTips](http://railstips.org). If you still need reason, motivation or general tips on testing, head over there immediately. If you're a fan of new year's resolutions, this is your chance. John Nunemaker is spot-on with this series.

So this month's motto is: Test Or Die!
