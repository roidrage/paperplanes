The [RSpec](http://rspec.rubyforge.org/) and [Behaviour-Driven Development](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd) edition:
* [Behaviour-Driven Development](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-rspec/). An excellent introduction to RSpec and BDD by Bruce Tate.

* [Introduction to RSpec](http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/articles/2007/05/14/an-introduction-to-rspec-part-i) by David Chelimsky.

* [Developing a Rails Model using BDD and RSpec](http://www.lukeredpath.co.uk/2006/8/29/developing-a-rails-model-using-bdd-and-rspec-part-1) by Luke Redpath. A year old, but still good for an overview.
