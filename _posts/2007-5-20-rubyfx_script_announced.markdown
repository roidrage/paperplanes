At first I was rather disappointed by what <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a> announced with <a href="http://sun.com/javafx/">JavaFX</a>, the newest competitor in the RIA market. In my taste F3 looks rather ugly and has a way too expressive syntax, compared to, say SVG. The target's not the same between these two, I know that, but comparing what code you need to draw, SVG is a winner. Anyway, that's not really the point.

An announcement on <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailsConf</a> shed a new light on JavaFX. A new framework called RubyFX is on a quest to close the gap between the DLR supporting Ruby and Sun's rather desperate attempt to get into the RIA market. The code looks very expressive, and to say the least, is what I'm talking about. It's still early alpha, but it looks promising.
