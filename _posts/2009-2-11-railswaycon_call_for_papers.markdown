On the heels of [RailsConf Europe's cancellation](http://en.oreilly.com/railseurope2008/) comes the call for papers for one of the viable alternatives, the RailsWayCon. It's happening from May 25th to 27th in Berlin, so other than going to Scotland on Rails like yours truly, this is the conference to go to.

But most importantly, you should hand in a submission for a talk or a tutorial, you know you want to. You can find all the nitty gritty details on the conference's [call for papers](http://it-republik.de/konferenzen/railswaycon/c4p/) page. Deadline is February 20th, so hurry!

See you there!
