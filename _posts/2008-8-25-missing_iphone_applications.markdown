Instead of disco balls, the 100th todo list application (I'm using OmniFocus, thank you very much) a coin flipper (just use a quarter, will ya?) or a face melter, how about something useful for a change?

 * Something for Git. Whatever it is. I'm sure someone will come up with a clever idea. Scott Chacon might be up to [something](http://twitter.com/chacon/statuses/891457363).
 * An SSH-Client that will let me configure my own keys. What am I supposed to do with freshly generated keys that I can only distribute, if I allow password access on my servers? No, thank you.
 * A MySQL-Client.
 * VoodooPad (not just [read-only](http://gkaindl.com/software/voodoophone))
 * A [Webistrano](http://labs.peritor.com/webistrano) client. [Duh!](http://github.com/mattmatt/macistrano/tree/master)
 * [TimeLog](http://www.mediaatelier.com/TimeLog4/). For those appointments where you can't/shouldn't use your MacBook.

My favorite apps so far
 * [OmniFocus](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284885288&mt=8). Better than the desktop version in my opinion. Syncs neatly over WebDAV, but in recent builds the nifty ninjas at the OmniGroup started implementing Bonjour-based synchronisation. Sweet!
 * [Twitterrific](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284540316&mt=8).
 * [Instapaper](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284942713&mt=8). A God-send (if you believe in that kind of stuff). Finally makes sense to me.
 * [Evernote](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=281796108&mt=8). Ditto.
 * [NetNewsWire](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284881860&mt=8)
 * [Exposure](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284919489&mt=8). Nifty little Flickr app by Fraser Speirs.

An honorable mention for the WordPress guys to release their [client](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=285073074&mt=8) as [open source](http://iphone.wordpress.org/).

Next on the shopping list:
 * [DataCase](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=287464320&mt=8)
 * A game maybe? Probably [Crash Bandicoot](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=285005463&mt=8).
 * [Twitterrific Premium](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284542696&mt=8). I already bought it for the Mac, and it's a neat little piece of software, so why not?

Update: Bought DataCase. Though not graphically perfect, still a nice little tool.
