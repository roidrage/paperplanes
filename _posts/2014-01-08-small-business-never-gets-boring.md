title: Small Business Never Gets Boring
topics: smallbiz

Things that have been on my mind lately:

- Implement lifecycle emails for our product to get new customers more to work
  with, using [customer.io](http://customer.io).

- How do I best write the copy for these emails?

- How can I increase customer retention?

- How can I reduce customer churn?

- How to get [everyone on the team doing customer
  support](https://37signals.com/svn/posts/3676-everyone-on-support)?

- How can we actively approach customers to get more insight into their
  problems?

- What kind of better and more insightful content can I produce for this and our
  [company blog](http://about.travis-ci.org/blog)?

- What blogs can I run guest posts on?

- How can I funnel more visitors from our
  [blog](http://about.travis-ci.org/blog) to our
  [product](https://travis-ci.com)?

- How can I make sure that everyone on our team is happy?

- How can I adopt selling bacon as part of our business model?

These are only a few things that keep my brain busy.

So many things in my head, so little time to do all of them.

Life running a small business is never boring.

I'm a newbie, every single day.
